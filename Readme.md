### Things i learn in this Project :

><b>HTML id attribute</b>

  - The id attribute specifies a unique id for an HTML element. The value of the id attribute must be unique within the HTML document.
  - The id attribute is used to point to a specific style declaration in a style sheet. It is used to manipulate the element with the specific id.

  - In the below example we have an < h1 > element that points to the id name "myHeader". This < h1 > element will be styled according to the #myHeader style definition in the head section:


    ```
        <style>
            #myHeader 
              {
                background-color: lightblue;
                color: black;
                padding: 40px;
                text-align: center;
              }
        </style>


        <body>

        <h1 id="myHeader">My Header</h1>

        </body>


    ```

>The project is a part of the learning from  [ Sir Hitesh Choudhary's ](https://github.com/hiteshchoudhary) course on FULL STACK JAVASCRIPT WEB DEVELOPER. The idea credit is his. I have understood the concepts and learned them by building this on my own with a bare minimum reference of source code (only when my efforts couldn't clear the roadblock). The way of execution is modified as per my viewpoint whenever is necessary.
